Intro Overview:
The software application that I want to design is called “Teeth Ltd”. Teeth Ltd is going to be an innovative application for oral health. Many individuals are suffering from gingivitis, plaque, and gum health. I want to design this application to help those heal their gum line and restore their enamel. One of the main reasons that oral health is suffering is the amount of time spent brushing each quadrant of the mouth. By avoiding teeth such as the molars bad bacteria can linger underneath the gumline causing many foul diseases to grow. This application will assist one in restoring their poor oral health to striving for healthier gums.

Functions:
The functions that this application will contain are a two-minute timer, a 3-D rendering of the mouth quadrants, Games that will be implemented to help younger users to be interested while brushing, a database where one can check their previous results and what are you eating, and users can play their choice of music. I believe the two-minute timer will help the users brush for the recommended time that the dentist suggests. With the 3-D rendering of the mouth quadrants, this will show one wear to be brushing I along with that showing which teeth need to be focused on more. Call moving on to games that will be implemented in the application. This will help to engage the younger audience to be excited to brush their teeth. With Teeth Ltd, consumers can play interactive games that will be linked to the toothbrush. We are happy to share that our application Teeth Ltd will have a database with all the user’s brushing histories. With this database, users may look at their improvement from where they started. This database can also be shared with their dentist which can help them design a personal plan for their oral health. Lastly, the function of this application will have an option to play music of choice by the users to capture their interests leading to healthier oral health.
